<h2 class="directions">Directions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</li>
  <li>Make the scones: Sift flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt into a large bowl.
    Cut in butter with a pastry blender or by rubbing between fingers until lumps
    are the size of peas. Stir in currants.</li>
  <li>Whisk milk and sour cream together in a measuring cup; gently stir into
    flour mixture until dough is moistened, being careful not to overwork the dough.</li>
  <li>With floured hands, pat dough into 2- to 3-inch diameter balls. Place onto the
    prepared baking sheet and flatten lightly. Scones should slightly touch each other.</li>
  <li>Make the egg wash: Whisk egg and milk together.
    Brush the tops of scones with egg wash and let them rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
